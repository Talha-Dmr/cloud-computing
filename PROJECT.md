📢 Announcement: Semester Project Assignment (Microservices – DevOps – Kubernetes)

Dear Students,

For your semester project, you are expected to work in teams and complete a full end-to-end modern software delivery pipeline. Please read the requirements carefully.
🧩 1. Project Requirements

Each team must complete the following steps:

    Develop your own microservices project
    (Your own code, not a template.)

    Containerize the application
    (Dockerfile, image build, best practices.)

    Install and use OpenShift or Kubernetes
    (Local or cloud-based cluster.)

    Implement DevOps practices to deploy the application
    (CI/CD pipeline, automation.)

    Set up monitoring and logging
    (Prometheus/Grafana, ELK, OpenShift Monitoring, etc.)

    Test the system
    (Functional, integration, load, API tests—your choice.)

    Present the project
    (Architecture, demo, lessons learned.)

👥 Team Size

    Teams may consist of 2 to 5 students.

    Teams of 2 are ideal, but if you can coordinate well, teams of 5 are also acceptable as long as every member has a clear role and contributes.

📌 Submission Requirements
1. Create a GitHub repository and share your project publicly.

Include:

    Source code

    CI/CD pipeline definitions

    Deployment YAMLs, Helm charts, etc.

    Documentation (README)

2. Prepare a presentation video (Video 1)

    Maximum length: 18 minutes

    Explain:

        Architecture

        Microservices design

        DevOps pipeline

        Kubernetes/OpenShift structure

        Tools used

        Each team member’s contribution
